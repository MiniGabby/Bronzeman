    intro: "Herblore starts with the Druidic Ritual quest (250 XP, level 3). Quests are the cheapest way through the first levels: Jungle Potion (775 XP), Recruitment Drive (1,000 XP) and The Dig Site (2,000 XP) together take you to about level 19. After that, making potions is the main method. Costs below are for 2,500 potions per hour.",
